## Retrofy - Simple web self-hosted emulator frontend

Yes. I really wanted to have a simple, easy-to-use self-hosted retro emulator, and no matter how much I looked, I couldn't find a simple web-based emulator solution that I wanted, so I start to create this project.

This project is powered by [emulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org/)  project. You can use all the same features you used in [emulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org/).

It's simple to use: put a game for each game system folder mapped to docker-compose, and let retrofy scan and play it.

The project is not yet complete, and we expect to see some sort of finished project deliverable by May 2024.
